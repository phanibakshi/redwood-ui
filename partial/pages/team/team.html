                                Bootstrap is a framework that uses some of the latest browser techniques to provide you with stylish typography, navigation, buttons, tables, etc. One of the primary changes in Bootstrap 3 is an emphasis on Mobile-First responsive design. The goal is to elevate the mobile experience to a first-class citizen of the design process, because several billion mobile users is quite a large market to tap into. So, sites built with the current Bootstrap version target mobile devices and scale for larger screens depending on screen size.
